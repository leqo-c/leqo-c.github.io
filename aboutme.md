Hi visitor! My name is Leonardo, and my expertise lies right at the intersection between Data Science and AI Engineering.

### My story

My passion for problem solving began at 16, when I first encountered Computer Science. Since then, I’ve been driven by curiosity and a desire to turn complex real-world challenges into actionable insights using programming and AI. 

I have a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science, both obtained at the University of Pisa in 2016 and 2018, respectively. My master thesis explored a solution to explain the predictions of image classification models, based on the [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) framework. Please check the [paper](https://arpi.unipi.it/bitstream/11568/1023226/2/pakdd2019investigating.pdf), presented at the _Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining_!
